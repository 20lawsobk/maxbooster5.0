3. **Production Start**: `npm start` - Runs compiled server from dist directory
4. **Database Migration**: `npm run db:push` - Applies schema changes using Drizzle

### Scalability Considerations
- **Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL with Neon for automatic scaling
- **File Storage**: Local storage (can be extended to cloud storage)
