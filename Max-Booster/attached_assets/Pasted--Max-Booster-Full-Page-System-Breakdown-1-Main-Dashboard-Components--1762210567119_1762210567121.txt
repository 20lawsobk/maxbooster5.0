# 🏁 Endgame Instruction
Feed this breakdown to Replit’s agent. For each page/system, it must **expand every component into atomic, testable units** with explicit verification, testing, and completion steps. No ambiguity, no TODOs, no skipped parts. You are a deterministic engineering agent tasked with finalizing the Max Booster AI Music Career Management Platform.  
Your mission: for each page and subsystem, break it down into atomic components and provide a complete specification for verification, testing, and completion.

## 🔹 Pages & Systems to Cover
- Main Dashboard
- Social Media Management
- DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)
- Royalties
- Advertisement (AI amplification model)
- Distribution
- Any shared backend services (auth, billing, analytics, AI orchestration)

---

## 🔹 For Each Page/System

For every component, output in this format:

[Component Name]  
  - Purpose: (role in the system)  
  - Required Inputs: (data, APIs, user actions)  
  - Expected Outputs: (UI state, DB changes, API/model responses)  
  - Verification Criteria: (how to confirm correctness)  
  - Testing Instructions: (step-by-step test cases, including edge cases)  
  - Completion Checklist: (final sign-off conditions)

---

## 🔹 Verification Rules
- Confirm UI renders correctly across devices.  
- Confirm backend endpoints respond with correct schema.  
- Confirm DB writes succeed and rollback on error.  
- Confirm AI model responses are deterministic and reproducible.  
- Confirm integrations (Stripe, social APIs, distribution APIs) return valid responses.  

---

## 🔹 Testing Rules
- Provide explicit test cases for happy path, edge cases, and error handling.  
- Include automated test hooks where possible.  
- Ensure all tests can be run independently and deterministically.  

---

## 🔹 Completion Rules
- A component is only marked complete when all verification criteria and test cases pass without manual intervention.  
- No ambiguity or TODOs remain.  
- Documentation is updated to reflect final state.  

---

## 🔹 Output Format
For each page/system, output a structured breakdown in the format above.  
Do not skip any component. Do not generalize. Expand each into atomic, testable units. Ensure no ambiguity remains.
