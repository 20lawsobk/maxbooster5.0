Pages & Routing  
- Landing page with hero section, platform overview, and “Get Started” CTA.  
- Pricing page: single plan offered in three tiers—Monthly $49, Yearly $399 (39/mo equivalent), Lifetime $699—with Stripe checkout and dedicated registration routes for each.

Design & UX

- Interactive feedback on all UI elements (loaders, toasts, form validation).  

Scalability & Security  
- Architect to handle billions of users simultaneously (microservices or serverless).

Deliverables  
- Fully commented front-end and back-end code (HTML/CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, server frameworks).  
- README with deployment steps, environment setup, testing commands, and maintenance guidelines.  
- Asset folder containing the logo and any custom plugin files.  

Development Approach  
1. Break each page into atomic components; verify 100% production-grade functionality before proceeding.  
2. Enforce professional coding standards (linting, formatting, commit hygiene).  
3. No placeholder or test code in final build—every feature must be fully implemented and verified.  
4. If any requested feature does not exist natively, build it in-house at mainstream platform quality.
