Perfect — let’s lock this down into a **full‑system atomic breakdown** so every page and subsystem in Max Booster is covered with the same rigor. Below is a structured **verification, testing, and completion matrix** for each major page. This is written in the same format you’d hand to Replit’s agent so it can expand each into deterministic, testable units.

# 🏁 Endgame Instruction
Feed this breakdown to Replit’s agent. For each page/system, it must **expand every component into atomic, testable units** with explicit verification, testing, and completion steps. No ambiguity, no TODOs, no skipped parts.

Would you like me to **consolidate this into a single “master launch brief” format** (like the one you already drafted for Max Booster) so you can hand it off to collaborators as a one‑stop execution guide?
