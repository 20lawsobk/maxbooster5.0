Use the color scheme and typography consistent with the attached screenshot.

Ensure that elements like buttons, sliders, text fields, and backgrounds use the same design tokens (i.e., color variables, font sizes, margins, etc.). And > - Ensure that all UI elements aren’t just cosmetic; they must be fully operational with front-end functionality, proper back-end connections, and interactive feedback.

Pages must be responsive to various screen sizes, with a consistent layout across devices.

Testing and Debugging:
Incorporate debugging and logging as needed.
Provide automated tests (unit/integration) for both the OAuth workflows and interactive UI elements.
Deliverables:

Fully commented code (HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, as well as necessary server-side code) that implements the above functionalities.
A README file describing how to deploy, test, and maintain the application.
Additional Notes:

Use modern web development practices and frameworks (React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS as applicable).
Double-check that the design layout, color scheme, and interactive functionalities match the provided screenshot.
Ensure consistent error handling and provide fallbacks where necessary. And Systematically break down each page into tiny pieces and treat each page like a intricate puzzle adding functionality to each piece before moving on the next to ensure that each page has 100% full production grade functionality and make sure you do it page by page not moving to next until you can 100% verify that the current one works at 100% compacity and make sure that each puzzle piece has their requirements to prevent errors when putting the puzzle together and please make sure that you follow professional coding and programming practices and procedures and i won't accept anything other than flawless perfected production-grade functionality no ifs ands or buts and focus on fully implementing all of the above and remember that i won't accept anything other than flawless perfected production-grade functionality no ifs ands or buts and that also means absolutely no test functionality makes the final cut/product and please update the logo throughout the platform and update the color scheme throughout the platform with the colors in the logo with the attached picture and for the advertisement page did you create the system that gets rid of the need for ad spend and completely custom AI model to combine all capabilities of native ad systems and boosts every single ad created by 100% of what any native ad system could ever could therefore getting rid of the need for native ad systems altogether and include url/text/image/audio to ad/social media post generation as well for both the advertisement and social media management pages and create an self-healing security system that heals itself faster than it can be hacked and then create a digitized it system that is second to none and all ai related functionality is required to be made in house and then run an audit on both security and functionality and if max booster doesn't get perfect scores keep working it until it does all of the requirements above are met and they are non-negotiable and i won't accept anything less that i requested which is also non-negotiable, Max Booster must be made into web, desktop, and mobile app versions
